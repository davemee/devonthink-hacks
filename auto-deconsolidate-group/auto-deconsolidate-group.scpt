# The way I use this program is through KeyboardMaestro.  I have a scheduled
# macro that executes this program every 10 minutes when DEVONthink Pro is
# running but is not the front application.  This makes DEVONthink do the work
# in the background automatically and avoids interrupting meÂ while I'm actively
# working in DEVONthink.
# =============================================================================

use AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later

# This sets the name of the tag to search for, to find groups to deconsolidate.
set markerTagName to "deconsolidate"

# Main body.
