Create document from template
=============================

In my quest to do as much as possible via keyboard shortcuts rather than having to reach for the trackpad, I had previously been using a Keyboard Maestro macro to invoke DEVONthink's _Data_ âžœ _New from Template_ menu item.  However, the first thing you always do after creating a new document is name it.  I had code in the Keyboard Maestro macro to create a name, but the interaction between Keyboard Maestro and DEVONthink was such that sometimes something would go wrong with selection and focus, and the name change wouldn't happen.  This got annoying enough that I wrote some AppleScript code to create new documents from templates and do the naming all in one go.
